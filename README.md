Project
Build a frontend UI that displays the GIFs from Giphy (https://giphy.com/) using Angular. A user visiting the website should be able to search for GIFs and see the list of results.
A visitor should be able to expand a GIF to see its details (user, rating, create and update date-time, or whatever you think is relevant).
When a visitor scrolls the page to the bottom, new GIFs are loaded automatically.
Create a mosaic layout and display a placeholder image when a GIF is still loading.
Give the visitor the possibility to sort GIFs by ascending or descending uploaded time.
Let the visitor mark some GIFs as “Favourites”: he should be able to retrieve their favorites GIFs in a “My Favorites” view, even after refreshing the page.
Provide a good user experience and pleasant UI.
Notes
Use the Giphy API endpoints: https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint.
